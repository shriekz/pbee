[SOLVED]26. Add testimonials.
This was a tough one, some of the examples and extensions were tried but they did not work. Currently, what seems to be working is that, i have put in an extension called Manv's testimonial slider and in that I am using the carouFredSel jQuery plugin to show it on the screen. Additionally, since jQuery does not work well with other libraries, the code needed to have a modification done so that rather than $, it is using the jQuery() function.

Need to add relevant styles for the testimonials.
